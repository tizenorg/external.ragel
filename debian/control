Description: compiles finite state machines into code in various languages
 Ragel compiles finite state machines from regular languages into C, C++, 
 Objective-C, D, Ruby or Java code. Ragel allows the programmer to embed 
 actions at any point in a regular language. Non-determinism can be 
 controlled through the use of embedded priorities and guarded regular 
 language operators. Ragel also supports the construction of scanners and 
 the building of state machines using state-charts. Ragel can be used to 
 create robust recognizers and parsers which run very fast. It can work 
 with integer-sized alphabets and can compile large state machines. 
 The generated code has no dependencies.
